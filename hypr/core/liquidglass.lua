-- Liquid glass: the hyprglass plugin adds refraction, an edge light and a soft
-- lens to the shell's glass (island, corner pills, dock, on-screen keyboard).
-- Optional (`liquidGlass` in user.lua / Settings > Appearance). Build it first:
--   ~/.config/hypr/scripts/hyprglass.sh
-- The plugin is bound to one Hyprland build, so only the file built for this
-- version is loaded.
--
-- hl.plugin.load() is declarative: it must run on EVERY config load while the
-- plugin is wanted. Hyprland loads what is declared and not loaded yet, then
-- reloads the config; a plugin no longer declared gets unloaded. (Skipping the
-- call once the plugin was loaded made it unload/load/reload forever until
-- Hyprland crashed.) With the switch off it is simply not declared.
--
-- Cost measured on the RTX 3060: no visible change in GPU use, Hyprland CPU or
-- power (within the noise of a playing video); ~40 MB more VRAM for its buffers.
-- It re-samples the background only when something behind a surface changes
-- (at most 30 times a second), otherwise it reuses the last frame.
